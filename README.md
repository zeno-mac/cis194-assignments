# CIS 194: Introduction to Haskell

Solutions to homework assignments from the University of Pennsylvania's CIS 194 course on functional programming in Haskell.

These solutions represent my learning journey through functional programming concepts. The code focuses on correctness and clarity over optimization.

I might revisit the solution to polish them

## Other resources I recommend:

- [Functional Education](https://bitemyapp.com/blog/functional-education/) - An overview of all the major resources on Haskell.
- [Haskell Book](https://haskellbook.com/) - Absolutely recommended if you're willing to spend the time. I'm still halfway through but it's really well written and clear; it goes much more in-depth and has helped me understand the topics that CIS 194 didn't explain or goes over quickly.
- [CIS 194 Solutions](https://github.com/bschwb/cis194-solutions) - Examples of solutions for all the assignments, really useful when I was stuck or wanted to see alternative (and often better) solutions.
